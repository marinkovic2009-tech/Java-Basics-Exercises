# Java Basics – From Switch Onwards

This repository contains my Java exercises, starting from `switch` statements and covering arrays, ArrayLists, HashMaps, and basic object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. It is designed to practice and strengthen fundamental Java skills with practical examples.

## Overview

The exercises focus on:

- **Control Flow:** `switch` statements, `if-else` conditions, and loops (`for`, `for-each`).
- **Data Structures:** Arrays, ArrayLists, and HashMaps.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Classes, objects, methods, and simple encapsulation.
- **Console-Based Interaction:** All programs run in the console; no GUI or frameworks are used.
- **Practice-Focused:** Exercises reinforce programming logic, problem-solving, and clean code practices.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/java-basics.git
